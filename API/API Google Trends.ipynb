        "# Google Trends API Data\n",
        "## - Introduction:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Primary Objective:\n",
        "The main goal of collecting Google Trends data for three distinct regions—Saudi Arabia, India, and the United Arab Emirates—is to analyze the interest in social media and mental health across these countries over specific time periods between 2020 and 2024. This analysis will help to understand how interest in social media evolves and its potential impact on mental health in these regions over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Secondary Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### - Trend Analysis Over Time:\n",
        "We aim to determine whether there is an increase or decrease in interest in social media and mental health in each region over the years. This will help identify any emerging patterns or changes in public concern related to these topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### - Cross-Country Comparison:\n",
        "This analysis will enable us to identify differences in interest between Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and India. For instance, do Arab countries exhibit similar trends regarding social media use and mental health compared to India? These comparisons can highlight regional variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### - Drawing Conclusions About the Potential Impact of Social Media:\n",
        "Based on the data, we will be able to form preliminary conclusions about the relationship between increased social media usage and the level of interest in mental health in each country. This may offer insights into how digital engagement correlates with mental health awareness or concern in different cultural contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Methodology:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Keyword Selection:\n",
        "We identified two groups of relevant keywords associated with the research topic. These keywords include popular social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, along with terms such as \"social media\" and \"mental health.\" This selection aims to measure public interest in these topics through Google Trends data.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Timeframe Definition:\n",
        "The data has been segmented on an annual basis, from 2020 to 2024. This approach enables comparisons between different years and helps to observe trends that emerge or shift over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Geographic Regions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Saudi Arabia: <br> Chosen as our primary target audience, it represents a key region for understanding trends within the Arab world.\n",
        "- United Arab Emirates:<br> The UAE was selected as it is the Arab nation with the highest usage of technology and social media, making it an important sample for studying trends in the region.\n",
        "- India:<br> India is the second-largest user of social media globally, after China. However, China was excluded from this analysis due to unavailability of data in Google Trends, since different apps are predominantly used there. India's inclusion offers a comparative perspective on external trends.\n",

        "5- Grouping Data:<br>Once we had the complete dataset, we grouped it by \"Year\" and \"Country\" to aggregate the keyword interest values using the groupby() and sum() functions, providing a summarized view of interest across keywords for each year and country.\n",
        "\n",
        "6- Column Selection:<br> After aggregation, we retained specific columns, including \"date,\" \"Year,\" \"Country,\" and all keyword columns, streamlining the dataset for easier analysis and visualization.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Keyword Grouping:<br> Due to API limitations, we divided the keywords into two groups. This was necessary to ensure the API could handle the requests efficiently and avoid errors.\n",
        "- Yearly Timeframes:<br> Since Google Trends only allows data retrieval based on specific date ranges (down to months and days), we manually defined the yearly ranges (e.g., '2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31') to capture trends over entire years. This allowed us to compare year-on-year trends for each keyword in each country.\n",
        "- Separate Data Processing for Each Country:<br> To maintain accuracy and manage API limitations, we processed the data for each country individually. This approach helped ensure that each country’s trends were collected correctly and allowed us to focus on the unique patterns in each region."

        "## - Challenges\n",
        "- Accessing Google Responses:<br>\n",
        "A significant challenge we encountered was managing multiple requests to the Google Trends API without exceeding the rate limits. To avoid server overload and ensure consistent data retrieval, we implemented a time.sleep(30) command to introduce a delay between each request. This step was crucial for maintaining stable API communication and avoiding request failures due to rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Timeframe Specification:<br>\n",
        "The Google Trends API does not allow direct yearly data retrieval and instead only supports queries based on months and days. To overcome this, we manually defined exact date ranges for each year (e.g., January 1st to December 31st). This allowed us to gather data for entire years, ensuring that the data was structured according to our yearly analysis needs. The process required aggregating monthly data into yearly summaries to align with our research objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Keyword Grouping Limitations:<br>\n",
        "The API enforces a limit on the number of keywords that can be queried at once. This limitation led us to divide the keywords into two distinct groups, with each group containing relevant social media and mental health terms. Although this increased the complexity of the data retrieval process, we combined the results during post-processing to ensure all keywords were included in the analysis. This required careful data management and merging.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Single Country Requests:<br>\n",
        "The Google Trends API only supports data extraction for one country per request. To manage this, we developed a function that iterated through the countries (Saudi Arabia, India, and the UAE) and collected data separately for each. This significantly increased the time required for data collection but ensured that each country's trends were handled independently, maintaining the integrity and focus of the research."
