        "#### Primary Objective:\n",
        "The main goal of collecting Google Trends data for Saudi Arabia is to analyze the interest in social media and mental health across the country over specific time periods between 2020 and 2024. This analysis will help to understand how interest in social media evolves and its potential impact on mental health in Saudi Arabia over time.\n",

        "#### Secondary Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### - Trend Analysis Over Time:\n",
        "We aim to determine whether there is an increase or decrease in interest in social media and mental health over the years in Saudi Arabia. This will help identify any emerging patterns or changes in public concern related to these topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### - Drawing Conclusions About the Potential Impact of Social Media:\n",
        "Based on the data, we will be able to form preliminary conclusions about the relationship between increased social media usage and the level of interest in mental health in the country. This may offer insights into how digital engagement correlates with mental health awareness or concern within the Saudi cultural context."

        "\n",
        "### Parameters\n",
        "- **country**: A string representing the country code (e.g., 'SA' for Saudi Arabia) from which to fetch data.\n",
        "- **keywords_group**: A list of groups of keywords (e.g., social media and mental health terms) to search for in Google Trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Function Workflow\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `country_data`: An empty DataFrame to hold the collected data for the specified country.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterating Over Years**:\n",
        "   - The function iterates through the `years` dictionary.\n",
        "   - For each year and its corresponding timeframe, the function processes each group of keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Fetching**:\n",
        "   - Inside the nested loop, the function prints a message indicating the year, keywords, and country for which data is being fetched.\n",
        "   - It calls the `fetch_data_with_retry` function to retrieve the Google Trends data. If the data is successfully fetched and not empty:\n",
        "     - It adds the current year and country as new columns to the data.\n",
        "     - The new data is concatenated to the `country_data` DataFrame.\n",
        "   - If no data is available for the specified year and keywords, it prints a message to inform the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Random Sleep**:\n",
        "   - After each data retrieval attempt, the function waits for a random amount of time (between 5 to 15 seconds) to avoid hitting the Google Trends rate limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Return Value**:\n",
        "   - Finally, the function returns the `country_data` DataFrame containing all the fetched data for the specified country."

        "\n",
        "In the analysis of the columns related to mental health and social media, we observed that the long phrases such as \"insomnia and social media,\" \"stress and social media,\" \"addiction and social media,\" \"depression and social media,\" and \"anxiety and social media\" did not yield valid results during the data requests.\n",
        "Google Trends did not recognize these keywords accurately, as reflected by the zero search interest across most years, which is an illogical outcome. Therefore, we recommend deleting these columns from our dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the presence of outliers in the remaining columns is significant as it indicates variations in search interest, whether increasing or decreasing. We suggest retaining these columns as they provide valuable insights into the fluctuations of public concern regarding social media and mental health.\n",

        "### Collection Methods:\n",
        "We employed the **pytrends** library to systematically retrieve data from Google Trends. This method enabled us to capture public interest trends related to social media and mental health across Saudi Arabia. Specifically, we used keyword searches within predefined timeframes, allowing us to gather region-specific data effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Decisions Made:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Keyword Grouping:**  \n",
        "  To optimize data retrieval, we divided the keywords into **four distinct groups**. This was necessary to ensure the API could handle the requests efficiently and avoid errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Yearly Timeframes:**  \n",
        "  Since Google Trends only allows data retrieval based on specific date ranges (down to months and days), we manually defined the yearly ranges (e.g., '2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31') to capture trends over entire years. This allowed us to compare year-on-year trends for each keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Merging and Cleanup:**\n",
        "  - **Combining Columns:**  \n",
        "    We merged the Twitter and Platform X columns into a single column named Twitter(X) since they represent the same platform. This step was crucial to avoid redundancy and streamline our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Handling Outliers:**  \n",
        "    During data cleaning, we identified outliers in several columns, which indicated significant deviations in search interest. We decided to retain these outliers in our dataset as they provided insights into unusual spikes or drops in interest related to social media and mental health. Furthermore, we decided to initially remove the keywords with long phrases. This decision was made because Google Trends struggled to process these keywords accurately, leading to zero search interest for most years. This action aimed to improve the overall quality and reliability of our data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Language Restriction:**  \n",
        "    Due to Google Trends' inability to effectively recognize Arabic keywords, we decided to limit our analysis to English keywords only. This decision ensured that we could gather more accurate and reliable data on public interest in social media and mental health topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Column Reordering:**  \n",
        "  For better organization and clarity, we reordered the columns in our final dataset to prioritize key variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**  \n",
        "The methodology and decisions outlined here provided a structured approach to analyzing Google Trends data, ensuring both accuracy and relevance in capturing public interest in social media and mental health in the selected countries. This process allowed us to derive meaningful insights while navigating the limitations of the Google Trends API."

        "## - Challenges:\n",
        "- **Accessing Google Responses**:<br>\n",
        "A significant challenge we encountered was managing multiple requests to the Google Trends API without exceeding the rate limits. To avoid server overload and ensure consistent data retrieval, we implemented a time.sleep(random.uniform(5, 15)) command to introduce a delay between each request. This step was crucial for maintaining stable API communication and avoiding request failures due to rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Timeframe Specification**:<br>\n",
        "The Google Trends API does not allow direct yearly data retrieval and instead only supports queries based on months and days. To overcome this, we manually defined exact date ranges for each year (e.g., January 1st to December 31st). This allowed us to gather data for entire years, ensuring that the data was structured according to our yearly analysis needs. The process required aggregating monthly data into yearly summaries to align with our research objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Keyword Grouping Limitations**:<br>\n",
        "The API enforces a limit on the number of keywords that can be queried at once. This limitation led us to divide the keywords into two distinct groups, with each group containing relevant social media and mental health terms. Although this increased the complexity of the data retrieval process, we combined the results during post-processing to ensure all keywords were included in the analysis. This required careful data management and merging.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Processing Long Phrase Keywords**:<br>\n",
        "   **Search Difficulties**: There were keywords with long phrases that Google Trends could not handle accurately, as most years returned zero results. This issue led to an initial decision to remove those keywords from the analysis and focus instead on analyzing shorter, more relevant phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Difficulty with Arabic Keywords**:<br>\n",
        "**Language Recognition Issues**: Google Trends struggled to recognize and process Arabic keywords effectively. As a result, the analysis had to rely solely on English keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**<br>\n",
        "In conclusion, our analysis of Google Trends data encountered several challenges, including managing API request limits, specifying timeframes, grouping keywords, and dealing with language recognition issues. By adjusting request intervals, defining precise date ranges, and focusing on English keywords, we maintained an effective data collection process. These challenges shaped our approach and enabled us to derive valuable insights into public interest in social media and mental health within the targeted regions."
