From these summary statistics, several key observations can be made:\n\n- Age: The ages of respondents range from 13 to 91 years, with an average age of 26.14. Most individuals are concentrated around the younger demographic, as seen from the 25th to 75th percentile values (21â€“26 years). The presence of a maximum age of 91 indicates a broad range, but the majority of responses are from younger individuals.\n\n- Social Media Usage Without Specific Purpose: Responses range from 1 to 5, with a mean of 3.55, indicating that many individuals frequently use social media without a specific purpose. Most responses fall within the 3 to 4 range, suggesting a tendency toward casual, purposeless browsing.\n\n- Distraction by Social Media: With a mean of 3.32, many individuals get distracted by social media while busy. The data shows variation, as the responses span the full scale from 1 to 5, with the majority clustered between 2 and 4.\n\n- Restlessness Without Social Media: The mean is 2.59, indicating that while some feel restless without social media, the overall restlessness is moderate, with most responses ranging between 2 and 3.\n\n- Ease of Distraction: On a scale of 1 to 5, the average score is 3.35, showing that most individuals find themselves moderately to highly distracted, as the majority of responses fall between 3 and 4.\n\n- Worries: With a mean of 3.56, most respondents experience worries to a moderate to high degree, as responses are skewed towards 4 and 5.\n\n- Difficulty in Concentrating: The mean score of 3.25 indicates that many individuals find it somewhat challenging to concentrate, with responses ranging widely from 1 to 5 but concentrated between 3 and 4.\n\n- Comparing to Successful People on Social Media: The mean score of 2.83 suggests that respondents sometimes compare themselves to others on social media, but the overall tendency isnâ€™t extreme. Responses are fairly distributed across the scale.\n\n- Feelings About Comparisons: With a mean of 2.78, most people have moderate feelings regarding comparisons made on social media. The responses are clustered mainly around 2 and 3.\n\n- Seeking Validation on Social Media: The mean score of 2.46 suggests that, on average, individuals seek validation from social media less frequently, though there is variation, with responses spanning from 1 to 5.\n\n- Feelings of Depression: With a mean of 3.26, individuals report feeling down or depressed fairly often, as responses cluster between 3 and 4.\n\n- Fluctuations in Interest in Daily Activities: The mean score is around 3, indicating that respondents sometimes experience fluctuating interest in daily activities, though there is some variability in how frequently this occurs.",

As the variance increases, it indicates that the values are more spread out and scattered away from the mean, whereas decreasing variance suggests that the values are less scattered and closer to the mean value. Therefore, our variance results indicate:\n\n\n- Age: The variance is 98.31, which indicates a high level of dispersion and spread of ages. This suggests that the age distribution in the dataset is wide, with respondents of varying ages.\n\n- Social Media Usage Without Specific Purpose: The variance is 1.20, indicating a relatively low dispersion in responses. Most individuals show similar tendencies in using social media without a specific purpose, suggesting a convergence around the mean.\n\n- Distraction by Social Media: The variance is 1.76, indicating moderate dispersion. This suggests that individuals' responses vary significantly in how often they get distracted by social media, but not extremely.\n\n- Restlessness Without Social Media: The variance is 1.58, indicating moderate dispersion. Responses are somewhat spread out, suggesting that individuals vary in how restless they feel without social media.\n\n- Ease of Distraction: With a variance of 1.38, there is relatively low dispersion, suggesting that most people report similar levels of distraction.\n\n- Bothered by Worries: The variance is 1.65, indicating moderate variation. Individuals have varying levels of concern or worry.\n\n- Difficulty Concentrating: The variance is 1.81, suggesting that the dispersion is moderate, with individuals showing different levels of difficulty concentrating.\n\n- Comparison to Successful People on Social Media: The variance is 1.98, indicating a fairly high level of dispersion. This suggests that people differ widely in how often they compare themselves to others on social media.\n\n- Feelings About Comparisons: The variance is 1.12, indicating a low level of dispersion. Most people have similar feelings about the comparisons they make on social media.\n\n- Seeking Validation on Social Media: The variance is 1.56, indicating moderate dispersion. People vary in how often they seek validation from social media.\n\n- Feelings of Depression: The variance is 1.72, indicating moderate dispersion in how often individuals feel depressed or down.\n\n- Fluctuations in Interest in Daily Activities: The variance is 1.58, showing moderate variation in how frequently respondents experience fluctuations in their interest in daily activities.\n\n- Issues Regarding Sleep: The variance is 2.14, indicating a relatively high level of dispersion. This suggests that people face varying degrees of sleep-related issues.\n\nIn summary, the variance is moderate to high across most variables, indicating diverse responses. Age stands out with a very high variance, while responses to feelings about comparisons show lower variability.",
