These decisions were crucial in designing the survey and analyzing the data in a way that aligns with the research objectives. Below are the most significant decisions we made:\n\n1. **Consulting Psychological Experts**:\n\nWe decided to reach out to psychology experts to ensure our survey questions were accurate and relevant to mental health.\n\n2. **Survey Language**:\n\nWe chose to distribute the survey in Arabic, as our target audience is Saudi, and using their native language would facilitate responses and increase participation.\n\n3. **Excluding Non-Social Media Users**:\n\nWe excluded 10 participants out of 852 who indicated they don’t use social media, as their small number made them statistically insignificant.\n\n4. **Converting Responses to a Numeric Scale**:\n\nWe converted qualitative responses to a 1-4 range to align with secondary data from Kaggle, which uses the same scale for easier comparison.",

These challenges ranged from technical issues concerning data quality to difficulties participants faced while completing the survey. Each obstacle required careful consideration and strategic solutions to ensure the validity and reliability of the collected data. Addressing these challenges was crucial for preserving the integrity of the research and obtaining meaningful results.\n\nHere are the main challenges we faced:\n\n1. **Questionnaire Design:** One of the significant challenges was developing a questionnaire with valid and effective questions that addressed the research questions. It was essential to ensure that the questions were clear and straightforward to avoid any confusion for the respondents. To tackle this, we collaborated with experts to review the questions, ensuring they aligned with the research objectives.\n\n2. **Questionnaire Fatigue:** This is a common issue, as lengthy questionnaires can cause participants to lose interest. To mitigate this, we designed a concise and focused questionnaire that included essential questions, dividing it into sections. The first section collected demographic data, followed by the primary research questions.\n\n3. **Misunderstanding of Questions:** Another challenge was the risk of participants misunderstanding the questions, which could result in inaccurate or irrelevant answers. To alleviate this, we employed simple language and provided examples for questions that required further clarification, making it easier for participants to understand and respond accurately.\n\n4. **Sample Diversity:** Achieving diversity within the sample across various demographics was also a challenge. To address this, we utilized multiple social media platforms, which allowed us to reach a broader audience.\n\nAfter completing the survey and gathering a substantial number of responses, we began to verify the results and encountered the following issues:\n\n**Unanswered Questions:** A significant issue was the presence of unanswered questions, with many participants skipping certain items, leading to incomplete data. This posed a risk to the accuracy and reliability of the results. To resolve this, we identified and removed rows with #VALUE during the data cleaning phase, ensuring the integrity of the remaining dataset was preserved.\n\n**Literal Translation Issues:** Throughout the project, we faced challenges with the literal translation of documents from Arabic to English, as noted in the pre-processing phase. Certain phrases and terms often failed to convey the intended meaning in English, resulting in confusion and misinterpretation of key concepts. To tackle this, we identified and corrected any inconsistent or incorrect values in our dataset, ensuring the original context and clarity were maintained. Additionally, we conducted thorough reviews of the translated content to identify and rectify any phrases that could lead to misunderstandings, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the document.\n\n",

While it fosters social interaction and support, it also poses risks such as anxiety and depression. These insights can inform the development of mental health interventions, including educational campaigns and support programs tailored for social media users.",
