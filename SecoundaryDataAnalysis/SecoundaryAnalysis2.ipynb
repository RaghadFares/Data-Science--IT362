The first key decision was identifying and removing outliers, particularly in the age column. We found that some age values were unrealistic, such as those exceeding 75 years. These values were considered outliers and removed them. Additionally, normalization was applied to the numerical features using decimal scaling. This technique helped transform values, like responses on a scale from 1 to 5, into a uniform range between 0 and 1, making them easier to compare. Finally, a thorough data integrity check was performed to ensure the dataset was complete and free from missing values. All entries were reviewed to confirm that every question was answered without any gaps or inconsistencies.",

      "source": "### Rationale Behind Decisions:\nThe rationale for these decisions was primarily to ensure the dataset was both accurate and usable for further analysis. Outliers, such as extreme age values, can distort results, leading to inaccurate insights. By removing or correcting them, we improved the data's overall reliability. Normalization was necessary to put all numerical responses on a comparable scale. For example, survey responses ranging from 1 to 5 had to be normalized so that no single variable would dominate the others during analysis. This step was essential for ensuring that all features contributed equally to any models or further statistical evaluations. The data integrity check was crucial to maintaining consistency, as missing data can introduce bias and affect the quality of the analysis.",

      "source": "### Challenges:\nSeveral challenges arose during the preprocessing phase. One major challenge was accurately identifying outliers. In particular, extreme values like very high ages required careful evaluation to determine whether they were errors or genuine cases. To resolve this, we used statistical techniques, such as interquartile range (IQR) analysis, to differentiate between valid outliers and erroneous data points. Another challenge was ensuring that the normalization process did not obscure or distort important patterns. For example, responses rated as a 5 on a 1-to-5 scale had to retain their relative importance after normalization. To overcome this, we applied decimal scaling carefully, ensuring the original relationships within the data remained intact. Finally, handling the different question types, such as categorical and numerical responses, was a challenge. We kept the categorical data in its original form while only applying normalization to numerical values, ensuring that no important information was lost or improperly transformed.",

Outliers, especially in age values, were identified and removed, resulting in a more realistic dataset. Normalization brought all numerical features into a consistent range, making them suitable for comparison and further statistical work. Additionally, a comprehensive data integrity check ensured there were no missing or incomplete entries. This systematic approach to preprocessing not only improved the datasetâ€™s overall quality but also made it more suited for advanced analysis, helping to guarantee accurate and meaningful insights going forward.",

Additionally, the sample is skewed towards a particular age group, limiting generalizability.

For instance, focusing on a sample restricted to a specific age group or platform could limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data introduces the risk of inaccuracies due to biases like inaccurate recall, which may distort the results and affect the overall conclusions.",

Additionally, using objective measurement tools like actual social media activity logs can enhance the accuracy of data. Collecting data from multiple social media platforms is also recommended to capture a broader range of experiences, ensuring inclusivity and diversity in the findings. These strategies will help provide a more comprehensive understanding of social media's impact on mental health.",
